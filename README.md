# Energy Efficiency Analysis of LEACH-Based Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks

This project evaluates the energy efficiency of three LEACH-based protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs): **MOD-LEACH**, **LEACH-C**, and **LEACH-One**. The implementation and analysis were conducted using MATLAB simulations.

### Key Features

1. **Protocol Implementation**:  
   Developed and compared three WSN protocols:
   - MOD-LEACH  
   - LEACH-C  
   - LEACH-One  

2. **Performance Metrics**:   
   - Energy efficiency  
   - Network lifetime  
   - Scalability   

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Graphs to highlight strengths and weaknesses of each protocol.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **MATLAB**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jaishmau39/LEACH_Protocols.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.

### Usage

1. Run the MATLAB scripts for each protocol to simulate the network.  
2. Adjust parameters such as network size, node distribution, and energy constraints to analyze varying conditions.  
3. View simulation results through the generated graphs.

## Results

- Comparison of energy efficiency by protocol.
- Energy consumption trends over time. 
- Analysis of network lifetime under varying conditions.
